# Expo Android Build Failure: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to Android builds in Expo CLI. The build process fails with the error message "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.AaptProcess". This usually points to issues with resources in your project, such as images, XML files, or other assets.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified Expo project structure.  The specific error causing the build failure isn't directly in the JavaScript code itself, but rather in how resources might be misconfigured in the Android project structure.  A common cause is an issue with images or XML files having invalid formatting, improper referencing, or exceeding the allowed size limits of AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool).

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution. While the JS code itself remains similar, it often involves checking and correcting the resource files within the `android` folder of the project (generated by Expo).
This may involve:

* **Image Optimization:** Compressing image files to reduce their size.
* **XML Validation:** Ensuring all XML files are correctly formatted and well-formed.
* **Resource Naming:** Checking for any issues with naming conventions or duplicate resource names.
* **Cleaning and Rebuilding:** Executing `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android` to force a clean build. 
* **Gradle Settings:** Checking for any misconfiguration in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.

Note:  The actual fix will depend on the specifics of your project's resource files. Consult the error log for more detailed clues.
