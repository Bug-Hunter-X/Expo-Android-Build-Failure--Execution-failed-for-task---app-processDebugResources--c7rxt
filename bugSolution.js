The solution often involves meticulous review and correction of the resource files within the Android project generated by Expo.  There is no single 'code' fix as the error stems from resource processing errors.  Common steps include:

1. **Clean Build:** Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android --clean`.  This clears the cache and forces a fresh build, often resolving transient issues.
2. **Image Optimization:** Use image compression tools to reduce the size of image assets. Large images are frequent culprits.
3. **XML Validation:** Carefully inspect all XML files (especially layout XML) for syntax errors, ensuring proper well-formedness.
4. **Resource Inspection:** Check for duplicate resources or resources with invalid file names (special characters, etc.).
5. **Gradle Settings (Advanced):** If the problems persist, examine `android/app/build.gradle` for any unusual configuration options.  Incorrect settings here can sometimes lead to resource processing errors. 
6. **Detailed Log Analysis:** Thoroughly read the complete error log produced during the build failure. Expo's error messages often contain clues pointing to the problematic resource.

Remember to rebuild after making changes to the Android project files.
